<p>GET STARTED PERKS RESOURCES COMMUNITY PRODUCTS CITY INFO COMMUNICATIONS CONTACT SEARCH  City Info City Information Partner Support Center Required Documents Airport Policies: Rideshare Partners Airport Policies: Commercial Partners Business Tax Registration Certificate Notification Hotspots Uber Lots & Zones Airport Policies: Rideshare Partners Get important information about airports in Southern California. LAX has announced new ground transportation regulations that allow rideshare drivers to pick up passengers at LAX  Per our agreement with the airport, rideshare partners are required to review both LAX Rules and Regulations and the Transportation Network Company Non-Exclusive License Agreement, and correctly complete a quick online quiz before beginning pick ups at LAX. If you have not already, you will receive an email with instructions on how to complete the quiz. Once you have successfully completed the quiz, we will mail you your Airport Vehicle Permit placard and you will be able to pick up passengers at LAX.  Remember, failure to follow LAX rules and regulations could result in a fine. You are responsible for any citations incurred at LAX. LAX RULES & REGULATIONS To review the LAX Rules and Regulations and learn more about picking up and dropping off at LAX, watch the video below.  REQUIREMENTS FOR PICKUPS AT LAX You must display the Uber “U” Trade Dress and your Airport Vehicle Permit placard on your windshield at all times when on LAX property, including the staging area and airport. The Airport Vehicle Permit placard must be below the Uber “U” Trade Dress on the right-hand, passenger-side of your windshield. An example is shown below:  Important:  You cannot display the trade dress of any other Transportation Network Company while dropping off or picking up a rider who requested through the Uber app. Additionally, you cannot display any Transportation Network Company trade dress or the Airport Vehicle Permit Placard while on a personal trip at the Airport.  You will only be able to pick up at the departures level of the terminals. When a rider requests a pickup, you will be notified of the terminal and airline where the rider is located.  QUEUEING ZONE AT LAX In order to receive pick-up requests, you must be located in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area outlined in the map below. Once you drive into the airport, or the Central Terminal Area, you will not be able to accept new rides. Additionally, the Transportation Network Company Non-Exclusive License Agreement prohibits you from circling the Central Terminal Area.  How it Works When you drive into the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area, you'll automatically be placed in queue for the next airport pick-up request.  The queue is first-in-first-out (FIFO). This means the person who has been waiting in the queue the longest will receive the next pick-up request. Your location in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area will not affect your place in the queue.  If you need to go offline or drive outside of the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area for any reason, please be aware that you will lose your spot in the queue. To be fair for all driver-partners, if you come back online or drive back into the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area after leaving you will be placed at the back of the queue. And don't worry, if a rider cancels their trip, you will still remain at the front of the queue.  While waiting for a trip request, please keep in mind that you'll need to obey traffic laws and parking signs. Drivers who use the Uber platform are expected to follow the rules of the road and all applicable traffic laws, including the LAX Rules and Regulations and parking restrictions at all times. You are responsible for handling incidents resulting in violations of those rules.  Below you can find a map of the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area.  Map Key  Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area:  This is the FIFO queuing area where you will be able to receive pick-up requests from LAX. This area is highlighted in yellow on the map. Pick-up requests are only sent to driver-partners who are within the highlighted yellow area and outside the LAX area (LAX highlighted in blue).  Designated TNC Staging Area:  This is a holding lot that you can park in while waiting for pick-up requests from LAX. This area is outlined in green within the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area on the map.  LAX:  This is where you will go to pick up and drop off riders. Note that you will not be able to receive trip requests while in this area. This area is outlined in blue on the map. 4 STEP GUIDE TO PICK UPS AT LAX  GATHER YOUR DOCUMENTS  LAX permit placard Uber trade dress  AWAIT LAX REQUESTS AT THE DESIGNATED TNC AIRPORT ASSIGNMENT AREA  You will only receive requests from LAX when you are in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area.  PICK UP AT DEPARTURES  All pickups must take place on the upper departures level. Call or text your rider to confirm their terminal and let them know you’ll pick them up near the rideshare signs at the upper departures level.     GET IN AND GET OUT  Your rider will meet you curbside by the rideshare signs on the departures level. We suggest you pull up, confirm their name, and start the trip. Circling the terminal is prohibited by the airport. Other Southern California Airport Policies Drop-offs by rideshare vehicles are permitted at all Southern California airports.  **Please be advised that YOU MUST display the Uber “U” Trade Dress while operating on airport property.  Pickups Are Permitted by Rideshare Vehicles at the Following Airports:  Burbank Bob Hope Airport (BUR) - see details below John Wayne International Airport (SNA - see pickup instructions here) Santa Barbara Municipal Airport (SBA) Pickups Are Not Allowed by Rideshare Vehicles at the Following Airports:  San Luis Obispo County Regional Airport (SBP) Meadows Field Airport (BFL) - Bakersfield Santa Maria Public Airport District (SMX) Santa Monica Airport (SMO) Ontario International Airport (ONT) Palm Springs International Airport (PSP) Long Beach Airport (LGB) Picking Up At Bob Hope Airport At Bob Hope Airport, both commercial and rideshare driver-partners are prohibited from picking up riders directly at the terminals. If you park curbside at the terminals, you may be fined.  How to Pick Up:   Bob Hope Airport has provided specific instructions below.  1.. Park your car inside the short-term parking structure. Find a parking spot or park in the designated rideshare pickup zone. 2. Meet your rider at their terminal and escort them back to your car in the parking structure.  3. Pay the $3 short-term parking fee. We will automatically add $3 to your fare for reimbursement.  How to Drop Off:   You can drop off curbside at Bob Hope Airport. Just make sure to always display the Uber "U" Trade Dress on your windshield!  Avoid Fines:  Bob Hope Airport police will issue fines to driver-partners who pick up riders curbside, double park, or park illegally. We will not be able to reimburse you if you're fined, so please follow the airport policies.

LAX has announced new ground transportation regulations that allow rideshare drivers to pick up passengers at LAX  Per our agreement with the airport, rideshare partners are required to review both LAX Rules and Regulations and the Transportation Network Company Non-Exclusive License Agreement, and correctly complete a quick online quiz before beginning pick ups at LAX. If you have not already, you will receive an email with instructions on how to complete the quiz. Once you have successfully completed the quiz, we will mail you your Airport Vehicle Permit placard and you will be able to pick up passengers at LAX.  Remember, failure to follow LAX rules and regulations could result in a fine. You are responsible for any citations incurred at LAX. LAX RULES & REGULATIONS To review the LAX Rules and Regulations and learn more about picking up and dropping off at LAX, watch the video below.  REQUIREMENTS FOR PICKUPS AT LAX You must display the Uber “U” Trade Dress and your Airport Vehicle Permit placard on your windshield at all times when on LAX property, including the staging area and airport. The Airport Vehicle Permit placard must be below the Uber “U” Trade Dress on the right-hand, passenger-side of your windshield. An example is shown below:  Important:  You cannot display the trade dress of any other Transportation Network Company while dropping off or picking up a rider who requested through the Uber app. Additionally, you cannot display any Transportation Network Company trade dress or the Airport Vehicle Permit Placard while on a personal trip at the Airport.  You will only be able to pick up at the departures level of the terminals. When a rider requests a pickup, you will be notified of the terminal and airline where the rider is located.  QUEUEING ZONE AT LAX In order to receive pick-up requests, you must be located in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area outlined in the map below. Once you drive into the airport, or the Central Terminal Area, you will not be able to accept new rides. Additionally, the Transportation Network Company Non-Exclusive License Agreement prohibits you from circling the Central Terminal Area.  How it Works When you drive into the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area, you'll automatically be placed in queue for the next airport pick-up request.  The queue is first-in-first-out (FIFO). This means the person who has been waiting in the queue the longest will receive the next pick-up request. Your location in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area will not affect your place in the queue.  If you need to go offline or drive outside of the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area for any reason, please be aware that you will lose your spot in the queue. To be fair for all driver-partners, if you come back online or drive back into the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area after leaving you will be placed at the back of the queue. And don't worry, if a rider cancels their trip, you will still remain at the front of the queue.  While waiting for a trip request, please keep in mind that you'll need to obey traffic laws and parking signs. Drivers who use the Uber platform are expected to follow the rules of the road and all applicable traffic laws, including the LAX Rules and Regulations and parking restrictions at all times. You are responsible for handling incidents resulting in violations of those rules.  Below you can find a map of the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area.  Map Key  Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area:  This is the FIFO queuing area where you will be able to receive pick-up requests from LAX. This area is highlighted in yellow on the map. Pick-up requests are only sent to driver-partners who are within the highlighted yellow area and outside the LAX area (LAX highlighted in blue).  Designated TNC Staging Area:  This is a holding lot that you can park in while waiting for pick-up requests from LAX. This area is outlined in green within the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area on the map.  LAX:  This is where you will go to pick up and drop off riders. Note that you will not be able to receive trip requests while in this area. This area is outlined in blue on the map. 4 STEP GUIDE TO PICK UPS AT LAX  GATHER YOUR DOCUMENTS  LAX permit placard Uber trade dress  AWAIT LAX REQUESTS AT THE DESIGNATED TNC AIRPORT ASSIGNMENT AREA  You will only receive requests from LAX when you are in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area.
