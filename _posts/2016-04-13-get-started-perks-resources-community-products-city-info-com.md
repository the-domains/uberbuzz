LAX has announced new ground transportation regulations that allow rideshare drivers to pick up passengers at LAX Per our agreement with the airport, rideshare partners are required to review both LAX Rules and Regulations and the Transportation Network Company Non-Exclusive License Agreement, and correctly complete a quick online quiz before beginning pick ups at LAX. If you have not already, you will receive an email with instructions on how to complete the quiz. Once you have successfully completed the quiz, we will mail you your Airport Vehicle Permit placard and you will be able to pick up passengers at LAX. Remember, failure to follow LAX rules and regulations could result in a fine. You are responsible for any citations incurred at LAX. LAX RULES & REGULATIONS To review the LAX Rules and Regulations and learn more about picking up and dropping off at LAX, watch the video below. REQUIREMENTS FOR PICKUPS AT LAX You must display the Uber "U" Trade Dress and your Airport Vehicle Permit placard on your windshield at all times when on LAX property, including the staging area and airport. The Airport Vehicle Permit placard must be below the Uber "U" Trade Dress on the right-hand, passenger-side of your windshield. An example is shown below: Important:  You cannot display the trade dress of any other Transportation Network Company while dropping off or picking up a rider who requested through the Uber app. Additionally, you cannot display any Transportation Network Company trade dress or the Airport Vehicle Permit Placard while on a personal trip at the Airport. You will only be able to pick up at the departures level of the terminals. When a rider requests a pickup, you will be notified of the terminal and airline where the rider is located.  QUEUEING ZONE AT LAX In order to receive pick-up requests, you must be located in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area outlined in the map below. Once you drive into the airport, or the Central Terminal Area, you will not be able to accept new rides. Additionally, the Transportation Network Company Non-Exclusive License Agreement prohibits you from circling the Central Terminal Area. How it Works When you drive into the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area, you'll automatically be placed in queue for the next airport pick-up request. The queue is first-in-first-out (FIFO). This means the person who has been waiting in the queue the longest will receive the next pick-up request. Your location in the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area will not affect your place in the queue. If you need to go offline or drive outside of the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area for any reason, please be aware that you will lose your spot in the queue. To be fair for all driver-partners, if you come back online or drive back into the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area after leaving you will be placed at the back of the queue. And don't worry, if a rider cancels their trip, you will still remain at the front of the queue. While waiting for a trip request, please keep in mind that you'll need to obey traffic laws and parking signs. Drivers who use the Uber platform are expected to follow the rules of the road and all applicable traffic laws, including the LAX Rules and Regulations and parking restrictions at all times. You are responsible for handling incidents resulting in violations of those rules. Below you can find a map of the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area. Map Key Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area: This is the FIFO queuing area where you will be able to receive pick-up requests from LAX. This area is highlighted in yellow on the map. Pick-up requests are only sent to driver-partners who are within the highlighted yellow area and outside the LAX area (LAX highlighted in blue). Designated TNC Staging Area: This is a holding lot that you can park in while waiting for pick-up requests from LAX. This area is outlined in green within the Designated TNC Airport Assignment Area on the map. LAX: This is where you will go to pick up and drop off riders.
